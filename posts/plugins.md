**Ciao**

Just a mini update on some project's I'm working on. I have been learning some basic python and after starting a new job at an architecture firm, I found myself using what I've learned so far in a practical application.

At the company the architects use Rhino to model their designs and I thought it might be useful at some point to incorporate those models into videos. My experience using a 3D modeler has been Blender so I started to look into their compatibility and see if they can work together. 

Rhino uses .3dm files which Blender doesn't read, but after searching a bit I found someone had made a plugin that you can install in Blender that accepts that file format.

There are a lot of issues that arise in video because of so many proprietary restrictions companies have on their products. "If you shoot on this camera you must accept our codec that no one else likes!" It's a way for them to keep their piece of the pie, but for many working in the industry you are often trying to find solutions around these problems because either the process or the price prohibits full brand adoption. For example, for a long time Sony had a particular kind of video codec that would make certain editing programs very angry if you tried to use them and in order for you to use the footage shot on Sony cameras, it would involve using another program to reproduce those clips (transcoding) into a different codec or format that would be acceptable to your editing program. Obviously this was a huge pain in the ass. Eventually many companies changed their practices, at the very least making options to making their products compatible with others.

 Before I started to learn coding, I would often ask other people their thoughts on solutions and if it was an easy fix I would adopt it. But many problems that came up would have solutions that involved changing the code base or altering the process that I never felt confident doing. Even my basic understanding of coding so far has helped break down these solutions in ways that lets me learn more about how they are implemented (even if I don't completely understand it).

What's great about Blender and other open source programs is that there's so much information from people in my shoes figuring out solutions to their problems and there's lot of documentation explaining how they are solving these problems. It's a really great resource for someone who's learning and figuring out what my own gaps are and starting to formulate my own solutions for them.
